# Terragrunt ROOT configuration — dev environment
# =============================================================================
# This file is the single place that configures the Terraform *remote state
# backend* (and a shared provider) for every module in the dev environment.
# Each child module includes this root via:
#
#     include "root" {
#       path = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
#     }
#
# and therefore inherits the same backend automatically — the configuration
# lives in exactly one place (DRY), so it cannot drift between modules.
#
# This root defines NO application resources by itself. It only wires up the
# backend and provider that the resource modules (Step 3 onward) build on.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# locals: the coordinates of the remote state backend. These describe WHERE
# Terraform state is stored, not what the platform deploys. They point at a
# dedicated state resource group / storage account, kept separate from the
# application resources so state is never removed by an app teardown.
locals {
  state_resource_group = "rg-antkart-tfstate"

  # NOTE: storage account names are GLOBALLY UNIQUE and must be 3-24 lowercase
  # alphanumeric characters. If this name is already taken, choose another and
  # update the bootstrap commands in the Infrastructure Guide to match.
  state_storage_account = "stantkarttfstate"

  state_container = "tfstate"

# remote_state: tells Terragrunt where to keep Terraform state and how to lock
# it, so the individual modules don't have to configure a backend themselves.
remote_state {
  # The azurerm backend stores state as a blob in Azure Storage. State locking
  # is built in: while an apply runs, the backend takes a *blob lease* on the
  # state file, so a second concurrent apply cannot acquire the lock and is
  # refused — operations are serialized and the state cannot be corrupted.
  backend = "azurerm"

  # generate: Terragrunt writes this backend definition into a `backend.tf`
  # file inside each child module at init time. That is how every module
  # inherits the same backend without copy-paste. `overwrite_terragrunt` keeps
  # the generated file in sync with this root on every run.

    # modules can never write to the same state.

    # use_azuread_auth: tells the azurerm backend to authenticate to the state
    # storage using Azure AD (Microsoft Entra) — the service principal's
    # identity from Step 1 — rather than a storage account access key. The state
    # storage account has shared-key access DISABLED, so Azure AD is the only
    # supported path; the service principal is granted the Storage Blob Data
    # Contributor role on the state storage account so it can read and write the
    # state blobs. No storage key or secret appears in this file or the repo.
    # (State is also encrypted at rest by the storage account by default.)

# generate "provider": Terragrunt writes a shared azurerm provider into every

# generate "versions": Terragrunt writes a shared required_providers constraint
# into every unit, so they all resolve the SAME provider versions. Pinning matters
# for REPRODUCIBLE, DRIFT-FREE provisioning: without a shared constraint,
# different units (or the same unit on different days) can pull different provider
# versions, so a plan that was clean yesterday can change for no code reason.
#
# BOTH providers are declared here so there is a SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for
# provider versions. azuread is only used by the app-registration unit, but
# declaring it globally avoids a second, hand-written versions.tf in that unit
# colliding with this generated one (Terragrunt will not overwrite a
# non-generated file). Units that don't use azuread simply don't reference it —
# declaring a provider it never uses is harmless.
#
# After changing these constraints, run `terragrunt init -upgrade` in each unit
# to align its .terraform.lock.hcl, then re-commit the updated lock files.
