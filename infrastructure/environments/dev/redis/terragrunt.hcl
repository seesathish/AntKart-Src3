# Terragrunt LIVE configuration — dev / Azure Cache for Redis
# =============================================================================
# The deployable instance of the redis module for the dev environment. The
# module says HOW to build the cache; this file says WHAT values to use and
# wires in the resource group it depends on.

# the shared providers from environments/dev/root.hcl.

# dependency: the cache lives in the resource group created by the
# resource-group unit. Terragrunt applies that unit FIRST and exposes its
# outputs here, so the real name is wired in — never hardcoded.

  # cache in the same region as Postgres: eastus is offer-restricted on this
  # subscription, so the data services are provisioned in the paired region.
