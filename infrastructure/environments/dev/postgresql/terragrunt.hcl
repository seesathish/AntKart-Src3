# Terragrunt LIVE configuration — dev / PostgreSQL Flexible Server
# =============================================================================
# The deployable instance of the postgresql module for the dev environment. The
# module says HOW to build the server and databases; this file says WHAT values
# to use and wires in the resource group it depends on.

# include "root": inherit the shared remote state backend (Azure AD auth) and
# the shared azurerm/azuread/random providers from environments/dev/root.hcl.

# dependency: the server lives in the resource group created by the
# resource-group unit. Terragrunt applies that unit FIRST and exposes its
# outputs here, so the real name and location are wired in — never hardcoded.
#
# NOTE: no key-vault dependency yet. The generated admin password and the
# per-service connection strings are copied into Key Vault in a LATER step;
# this unit only provisions the server and databases. Wiring KV here now would
# couple secret storage to server creation before that step is designed.
